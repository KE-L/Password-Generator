# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Description:
The purpose of this project is to create an application which generates random password, which displays in the browser. 

# Project Requirements/Acceptance Criteria 
* Generate a random password powered by JavaScript code, to dynamically feature HTML & CSS
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

# Core ideas: 
* Employing Prompts & confirm to define user choice 
* Storing variables to inform selection
* Engaging variables with random function 
* Introducting a random seletion from each array
* Reducing charaters repeating in error (trim) 
* Identifying correct for loop to adapt to varying password length 


# Challenges & Lessons:
* Adapting to password length critera in password generation 
* Effectively naming classes & ids for streamlined design
* Positioning corrective statements to ensure selection critera is met
